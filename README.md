# 🚗 Vehicle Fuel Efficiency Prediction Using Simple Linear Regression  
## 📘 Coursera Guided Project

I developed this project as part of a Coursera Guided Project, simulating a real-world scenario where I acted as a data science consultant for a major automotive manufacturer. The objective was to build a predictive model using simple linear regression to understand the impact of vehicle horsepower on fuel efficiency (Miles Per Gallon - MPG).

## 🎯 Objective

 Predict fuel consumption (MPG) based on vehicle horsepower using a simple linear regression model built with Scikit-Learn.

---

## 📊 Dataset Overview

- File `FuelEconomy.csv`
- Features
  - `Horsepower` – Independent variable (X)
  - `MPG` – Dependent variable (Y)

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Language Python
- Environment Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries  
  - `pandas`, `numpy` – Data handling  
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn` – Data visualization  
  - `scikit-learn` – Model building & evaluation

---

## 🔎 Project Workflow

1. Data Loading & Cleaning  
   Imported the dataset and performed basic preprocessing.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
   Visualized the relationship between horsepower and MPG using scatter plots and correlation analysis.

3. TrainTest Split  
   Divided the data into 80% for training and 20% for testing.

4. Model Training  
   Trained a simple linear regression model using Scikit-Learn.
